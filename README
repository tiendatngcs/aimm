*** AI-MMU Project ***
----------------------

Project Description:
--------------------
The full form of AI-MMU is Artificially Intelligent Memory Management Unit. 
The project aims to design an intelligent memory management system with the 
help of Reinforcement Learning, which can manage page-frame mapping in any 
large scale unified memory network efficiently. We target to achieve the 
optimum performance multi-programmed workloads, which is a superset of single
program workload. Each of the programs can either be multi-threaded or single-
threaded. Target applications will be able to receive the maximum benefit if
they have repeatitative executions, or very long execution time exhibiting 
large memory footpring and working set size. However, AI-MMu is not limited 
to only those kind of applications, as it is a very generic approach to support
any kind of applications in any volume. 

-----------
Compilers:
-----------
Python 3.6.0
GCC 4.8.5 or higher

-----------
Tools Used:
-----------
1. tensorflow == 2.13.1
2. keras == 2.13.1
3. keras-rl2 == 1.0.5
4. gym == 0.17.1
5. aimmu-sim (in-house)

-----------------------------
Setup suggestions/directions:
-----------------------------
-> clone the git repo aimmu_project from github.tamu.edu (it is a private project)
-> make sure you create your own brnach first and work and make changes only in your branch 
-> download the python-3.6.0 source folder in your local directory (outside of the project)
-> create virtual environment using venv and activate using "source /path/.../Python-3.6.0/virtual_env/bin/activate"
-> install pip in your system
-> using "pip install package==version" //install the required packages
-> once you have the packages make sure you have following folder structure
	-> aimmu_project
	   -> aimmu
	   -> trace_folder (remove .demo extensions from the trace file, only for the first time)
	-> don't worry about rest of the folder structure as you would have already received from github
-> go to aimmu_project/aimmu/gym-memenv 
	-> pip install -e . //execute this command and it will create the mem environment (gym)
-> go to aimmu_project/aimmu/gym-memenv/gym_memenv/envs (this is our main working folder)
	-> change the path to your Python-3.6 virtual environment active script 
	-> then source set_env //setting up python environment
-> for run commands check the "runall.sh" file

-----------------
Test run command: 
-----------------
To check if your configuration and setup is ready, you can run the following command

python simulate.py --aimmu-config setup/kmeans_learning.cfg --replay-buff-sz 10000
